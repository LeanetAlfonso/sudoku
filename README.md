# Sudoku

Sudoku app built with React.

Sudoku is logic-based puzzle whose objective is to fill a 9 Ã— 9 grid with digits 1 - 9 so that each column, row, and box contains no repeated values.

If you win you can save your score on the leaderboard and if you are feeling competitive, you can also challenge a friend so they can try to break your record!
